## 1. Variable Expansion ($VAR)

Basic Expansion: `$VAR` expands to the value of the environment variable `VAR`. If `VAR` is not set, it typically returns an empty string.
Surrounding Text: If thereâ€™s surrounding text, like `$VARtext`, the shell tries to expand `VAR`, and the rest remains as is. If `VAR` is unset, you get text.
## 2. Special Characters with $
`$-`: Expands to the current shell flags (e.g., himBHs).
`$~`: Tilde (~) expansion doesn't combine with `$.` So `$~VAR` will be treated as a literal string unless specifically handled in your shell.
`$+VAR`: + isn't special in this context, so `$+VAR` is treated as a literal string.
`$*`: Expands to all positional parameters (arguments). It's more relevant in scripts.
`$#`: Expands to the number of positional parameters.
`$?`: Expands to the exit status of the last executed command.
`$$`: Expands to the process ID of the shell.
`$!`: Expands to the process ID of the most recently executed background command.

## 3. Handling Wildcards (*)

`*` in Variable Names: If * appears in a variable name like `$VAR*`, it's typically treated as part of the name. Since `VAR*` is not a valid variable name, expansion will fail, and the rest of the string might be printed as is.
Standalone `*`: When used alone (not in a variable), * is a wildcard that matches all filenames in the current directory.
## 4. Unrecognized Patterns
Unrecognized Patterns with `$`: If the shell encounters an unrecognized pattern after `$` (like `$~VAR` or `$+VAR`), it might treat the whole pattern as a literal string.
General Rule:
The shell first tries to recognize special characters following `$`.
If it finds a recognizable pattern (like a valid variable name or a special parameter), it expands it.
If the pattern is unrecognized, the shell may treat it as a literal string and output it unchanged.
